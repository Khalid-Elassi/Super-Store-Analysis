# Super-Store-Analysis
Here is my first Project using Tableau during my training at BBI.

This project Works on the "Global Superstore" data set.
This Dashboard mainly gives insights about Sales, Profit, Categories, Sub-Categories .. etc.

I analyzed and designed an interactive dashboard containing the below points:
- Change between different charts on the same page.
- action to change between different pages.
- drilling down.
- hierarchy, Context filters.
- Create top N (5,6,10 parameters).
- "LODs" functions.
- custom visuals.
- parameterized measures on two levels.
- Multiple filters of dimensions and chart filtering out top N create.
- YOY KPI.
- MOM KPI.
